HERS is acronym for Human Emotion Recognition System
Its an AI which takes two real time inputs
The inputs are:
1.Live video recording of a person's face
2.Live audio recording 

Goal: 
To make a self learning device which is able to recognize people's emotions and respond correspondingly.
temporary goal:
the  primary goal is to build  an input processing system which takes these inputs, process them and store it in a database.
the secondary goal is to build a support vector machine which reads data from the database and process it
Note: No actual input is stored during any of these processes, the processed data will be in form of real numbers or objects carrying real numbers.
the tertiary goal is to build a UI upon the SVM. Which displays the video feed, shows visualization of the audio feed and also display the emotion
the fourth goal is to replace the emotion display system with a emotion responding system

PROGRAMMING
programming is done in python.
the UI and VM are build in python
